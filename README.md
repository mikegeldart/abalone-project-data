# abalone-project-data
part of the data management course setting up my abalone data in a repository


The link to my Rmarkdown is below:

For context:
AbaloneT1 = Abalone 2.1 (Prob 1) - Temperature   (Â°C)

AbalonePH1 = Abalone 2.1 (Prob 1) - pH   

Abalone T2 and T3, as aswell as AbalonePH2 and PH3 follow the same pattern, but are just measured with different probes.

Fortunately, I have been given a neat data set that doesnt require too much modification.

For my project I will be investigating abalone aquaculture in South Africa. Specifically, I will be looking at the Integrated Multi Trophic
Aquaculture system (IMTA) used in an abalone farm and how different recirculation rates used in an IMTA may have different effects on
the abalone species Halitois Midae. The data was collected from the project running at the Buffelsjags abalone farm. The Buffelsjags
abalone farm currently uses an Ulva raceway and 50% recirculation as standard practice. Toxic abalone byproducts are removed
through bioremediation. An ulva raceways act as a biofilter, whereby the the effluent and ammonium produced by the abalone are
stripped out of the water. I will be using a 50%, 75% and 100% recirculation rate to analyse how the biological and chemical interactions
associated with an increase in recirculation levels will influence the abalone stock, in terms of productivity and water quality. Each
platform consisted of 1 Ulva raceway with +/- 2000kg of Ulva linked to 48 abalone raceways containing 15 000kg Abalone and 3
platforms were measured. The data is first collected in the Ulva Raceway for 2 weeks and then placed in the Abalone Raceway for 2
weeks in the 50% (normal operation) and the 75% trials. The 100% trial are only data from the abalone raceways, because all the
probes are needed to monitor the system and ensure that no abalone will be lost. 2 hourly measurements were made on the systems
during this time with nutrient data included.
