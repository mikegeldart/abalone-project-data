# abalone-project-data
part of the data management course setting up my abalone data in a repository


The link to my Rmarkdown is below:
file:///C:/Users/micge/Desktop/project/data/rmarkdwon.html

For context:
AbaloneT1 = Abalone 2.1 (Prob 1) - Temperature   (Â°C)

AbalonePH1 = Abalone 2.1 (Prob 1) - pH   

Abalone T2 and T3 as aswell as AbalonePH2 and PH3 follow the same pattern just measured with different probes.
